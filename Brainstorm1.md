# Goals
An immediate goal is around defining the space and creating thought-leadership materials (conference or webinar). 
Professional goals include being able to utilize our leadership in defining this, to enable customer success.

# Theme: Culture Change
General patterns of seeing both devops and inner source in client interest has been occuring for both RH and Wipro. 
Culture change of both dev teams, and the other departments is a common point of interest to large companies. Whether this is expressed as DevOps or Open Source strategies, or Agile, there is ongoing corporate buzz and true need calling for this theme of culture change.

Change is happening at three levels:
- Culture
- Technology
- Development Model

Why are orgs comign to us?
Organizations are looking for a change agent to act as a forcing factor.

Malc and Nick:
- 1 in 10 are doing Agile "right"
- Agile has seen limited proper instantiations at large org's
  - They get part of it, but not all. 
  - "Agilefall" Agile+Waterfall
  - Management doesnt change their participation


# Parent/child relationship?
Nick question: "Is inner source / open source an umbrella that DevOps and Agile fall under, or are they not necessarily parent/child relationships of eachother?"

Malc:
- "Cant do DevOps without open source"
- Similarties include:
 - bottom up innovation
 - tooling
 - design
 
Chris:
- "Not sure that DevOps requires OSS"
- Instead, open source tooling and qualities encourages a better DevOps implementation
 
Andrew:
- Overlaps
- Dependancies
are found within each of the 3 models. We need to discover these with our conglomerate brainpower.

Malc:
- Orgs may want to do CI, but not necessarily OSS
- The Traits and Elements of Inner Source are more important than the naming or association with open source

# Moving fwd
- Nick has created a public google doc to compare and contrast the 3 methods
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PInbZW6BaaChsSa8EeLeSADg03Bjo9qCIhCkUI-A_fI/edit?usp=sharing
