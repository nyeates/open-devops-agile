>"In terms of Inner Sourcing and community led projects, we're seeing
these not just as part of an Open Source Strategy/Governance initiative,
but also part of DevOps and Cloud projects, where organizations are
looking to drive innovation bottom up (whilst directing it, to some
extent, top down).”

# DevOps according to Chris Pitman

This was quickly spurred on Chris and so was more a conversation between him and I off the top of his head….

## DevOps qualities
Steps of evolving culture: unsilo’ing - sharing - transparency, additional feedback cycles (process and people just talk across teams) (colocate, same team, part of agile, )

## DevOps methods / patterns
Scripting (valuable asset, dev resource, reusable), automation, agile dev across everything
Config Mgmt - websphere module shared everywhere
 - Puppet - sys admins
 - Chef - Ruby

# Is DevOps implemented in open source?

Chris feels that open source has weak interaction between development of code and actually implementing it in a real environment.

Nick disagreed and said that those implementing and spending time on projects tend to be people who are scratching an itch, whether personal or professional, and are actually using the project in a real-life scenario. The devs ARE the power users.

Chris tried to think of examples where this is not the case (got caught short by time)…. maybe where devs are hired and brought in to work on open source because of business reasons (finalize product, make more money for target market). Does this happen at Red Hat??
