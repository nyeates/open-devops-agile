Attempting to bring together three schools of modern software development thought:
- Open source / inner source
- DevOps
- Agile

Context
=======

Software development has changed dramatically in the 21st century. Inclusive in this category is everything from business needs and idea inception to the writing and operating of software code. The advent of open source software spurred self-organizing transparent development practices in the 1990's that continue to lead large distributed development projects to new places [1][2]. Inner source takes these same principles and applies them inside the corporate firewall [3]. Starting in the early 2000's, new methods for team-based software development were introduced by the likes of the Agile Manifesto [4]. And in 2009, a grassroots movement started as "DevOps Days" kicked off a revolution encouraging cross-disciplinary teams to interact at a greater level [5].

These three movements / ideologies have mostly been self-propelled and defined within each unto themselves. This project aims to bring experts in each field together, to figure out an enveloping picture and definition of these three powerful movements.
